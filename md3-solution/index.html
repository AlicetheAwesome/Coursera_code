                                Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.
                                Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or 
                                hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, 
                                and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.
                                Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, 
                                frying, and boiling, among many others, depending on its purpose. Since the latter half 
                                of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes 
                                cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.           
                                The poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on a range of 
                                forms across different parts of the world. In developed countries, chickens are typically 
                                subject to intensive farming methods, while less-developed areas raise chickens using more 
                                traditional farming techniques. The United Nations estimates there to be 19 billion chickens on 
                                Earth today, making them outnumber humans more than two to one.

                                    Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. 
                                    Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times.[1] Beef is a source of high-quality 
                                    protein and nutrients.
                                    Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as 
                                    roasts, short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, 
                                    hanger steak, etc.), while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, on the 
                                    other hand, are usually mixed with meat from older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, 
                                    minced or used in sausages. The blood is used in some varieties called blood sausage. Other parts 
                                    that are eaten include other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the 
                                    reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), 
                                    the heart, the brain (although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, 
                                    BSE, commonly referred to as mad cow disease), the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull 
                                    (known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some intestines 
                                    are cooked and eaten as is, but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings. The bones 
                                    are used for making beef stock.
                                    Beef from steers and heifers is similar. Depending on economics, the number of heifers kept for 
                                    breeding varies. The meat from older bulls, because it is usually tougher, is 
                                    frequently used for mince (known as ground beef in the United States). Cattle raised 
                                    for beef may be allowed to roam free on grasslands, or may be confined at some stage in 
                                    pens as part of a large feeding operation called a feedlot (or concentrated animal feeding operation), 
                                    where they are usually fed a ration of grain, protein, roughage and a vitamin/mineral preblend.
                                    Beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, accounting for about 25% of meat 
                                    production worldwide, after pork and poultry at 38% and 30% respectively. In absolute numbers, 
                                    the United States, Brazil, and the People's Republic of China are the world's three largest 
                                    consumers of beef; Uruguay, however, has the highest beef and veal consumption per capita, 
                                    followed by Argentina and Brazil.

                                Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯꜜɕi] or [sɯɕiꜜ]) is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice 
                                (鮨飯 sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ neta), 
                                such as seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary 
                                widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).
                                Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice 
                                or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, 
                                tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger 
                                (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.
                                Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced 
                                raw fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.
