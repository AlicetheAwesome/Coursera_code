                            Daisies belong to the daisy family of Compositae, now known as Asteraceae in flowering plants. 
                            Daisies are native to north and central Europe.
                            The origin of the word Daisy is the Anglo Saxon “daes eage” which literally mean “day’s eye”. 
                            It was called this because daisies open at dawn as the day just starts to begin.

                            The olive, known by the botanical name Olea europaea, meaning "European olive", 
                            is a species of small tree in the family Oleaceae, 
                            found in the Mediterranean Basin from Portugal 
                            to the Levant, the Arabian Peninsula, and southern Asia as 
                            far east as China, as well as the Canary Islands and Réunion. 
                            The species is cultivated in many places and considered 
                            naturalized in all the countries of the Mediterranean coast, 
                            as well as in Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Java, Norfolk Island, 
                            California, and Bermuda.

                            Pines are long lived and typically reach ages of 100–1,000 
                            years, some even more. The longest-lived is the Great Basin 
                            bristlecone pine, Pinus longaeva. One individual of this 
                            species, dubbed "Methuselah", is one of the world's oldest 
                            living organisms at around 4,600 years old. This tree can be 
                            found in the White Mountains of California.[5] An older tree, 
                            now cut down, was dated at 4,900 years old. It was discovered 
                            in a grove beneath Wheeler Peak and it is now known as 
                            "Prometheus" after the Greek immortal.
